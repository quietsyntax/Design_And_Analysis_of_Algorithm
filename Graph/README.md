# 🌐 Graph Algorithms

This folder contains implementations and explanations of important **graph algorithms**, a crucial part of competitive programming and technical interviews.

Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects, and solving graph problems builds your understanding of real-world connectivity and optimization.
