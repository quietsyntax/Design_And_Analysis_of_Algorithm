# 🧠 Dynamic Programming (DP)

This folder contains problems and solutions related to **Dynamic Programming** – one of the most powerful problem-solving paradigms in algorithm design.

Dynamic Programming is used when a problem has:
- **Overlapping subproblems**
- **Optimal substructure**

We solve such problems using either:
- **Top-Down (Memoization)**
- **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**
